              Are the risks of underage drinking worth advocating for a change
              in public opinion and formal legislation for; and if so what would
              that legislation entail?
            </p>
            <div class="card-after">
              <p>
                I don't believe that the best path forward involves legislation
                regulating alcohol. Prohibition clearly demonstrated that
                government regulation of goods tends to only increase the
                popularity and crime relating to said goods. It seems to me that
                the legal drinking age should actually be lowered to eighteen
                years old instead of the current twenty one in order to be more
                consistent with other legislation designed to protect minors.
                However, that is not to say that I encourage drinking under the
                age of twenty one.

              How has underage Drinking changed over the years? To what extend
              has it become more or less prevelant? How has the public opinion

                The academic literature is unclear on this matter: there are
                many contradicting sources and claims. Anecdotally speaking, it
                seems to be the case that abstaining from alcohol consumption
                from the ages of sixteen to twenty is somewhat of an
                abnormality.

                There is no conclusive evidence to explain this phenomenon. It's
                clear that alcohol has always been a popular vice, not only in
                the Western world but around the globe. I conject that its
                popularity stems from its ease of brewing coupled with its
                ability to ease angst.

                There are plenty of organizations dedicated to the issue of
                alcohol abuse, for example, Alcoholics Anonymous. Nothing aimed
                to reduce alcohol consumption in general is currently being done
                that is worth noting. This is likely due to the popularity of
                alcohol: it would be extremely difficult for a movement of this
                sort to gain traction.

                Alcoholism seems to be a multifaceted issue. Some likely factors
                are a genetic predisposition to addiction, chronically low
                serotonin levels, and early exposure to alcohol.

            Going forth, I have the knowledge required to construct and defend a
            formidable position regarding alcohol use and its effects. My
            greatest hope is that I can be a positive influence for those I care
            about and dissuade others from making poor decisions relating to
            alcohol consumption.
